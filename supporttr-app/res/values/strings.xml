    <string name="info_qrreader_text">Thanks for trying out Supporttr :) For easy input of Bitcoin addresses you need a QR-Code scanning app. Would you like to download one for free?</string>
 
    <string name="info_walletmissing_title">Missing Bitcoin Wallet App</string>
    <string name="info_walletmissing_text">For sending Bitcoin donations you need a wallet app. Would you like to download one for free?</string>
    
    <string name="info_walletunsupported_title">Unsupported Bitcoin Wallet</string>
    <string name="info_walletunsupported_text">It seems that you have local Bitcoin wallet installed on your device - but its not tested with the Supporttr app yet. You can try if it works and let us know - but would you like to be on the safe side and download a supported wallet for free?</string>

    <string name="info_walletKnc_title">Unsupported KNC Wallet</string>
    <string name="info_walletKnc_text">You have only the KNC Wallet installed. Last time we checked they have deactivated their support for Bitcoin-URIs payments. Would you like to additionally download a supported wallet for free?</string>
  
    <string name="info_walletBlockchain_title">Unsupported Blockchain.info Wallet</string>
    <string name="info_walletBlockcain_text">You have only the Blockchain.info Wallet installed. Last time we checked they had a bug in their support for Bitcoin-URIs payments. Would you like to additionally download a supported wallet for free?</string>
    
    <string name="info_walletNoPaymentRequest_title">Missing feature in your wallet app</string>    
    <string name="info_walletNoPaymentRequest_text">As far as we know the wallet app you have installed has no support for the BIP70 payment protocol yet. So you need to authenticate every single donation manually and multiple Bitcoin transactions fees need to be paid in the process. Would you like to additionally download a wallet that supports this feature for free? Cancel to use your actual wallet.</string>
